# Fake-news-detector

Using Python and Natural Language Processing techniques, I created a fake news detector to filter out false
information.
Four combinational models were used to train the classification model on Subreddit posts from r/TheOnion
and r/nottheonion.
Find out the model with best score, and acquired hands-on experience in machine learning and natural
language processing.
